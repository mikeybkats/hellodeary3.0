          <p class="sub-title">For about ten years I was simply someone who dabbled in web technologies. Most of my life Iâ€™ve been an artist. I make music, sketch, paint, construct things out of wood. I also design and make bags, accessories and shoes. Ever since high school I have had a desire to code. At the time I had a few friends who were making stuff in C++, and that just really made a big impression on me. Since then I've always wanted to be a builder with a high degree of output.</p>

          <p class="sub-title">In 2016 I started at Codefellows. There, I learned to take problems one small bite at a time. And, as a relatively new developer this philosophy gives me confidence and the ability to tackle a wide range of different problems.</p>
